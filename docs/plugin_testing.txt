Export Layers (repeat)
----------------------

Interactive
* load settings from GIMP shelf and config file
* first run
  * display "Export Layers" dialog
* subsequent runs
  * display "Export Layers (repeat)" dialog

Non-interactive
* same as Run-with-last-vals

Run-with-last-vals
* load settings from GIMP shelf and config file
* save settings to GIMP shelf after export


Settings
--------

Basic settings
* Output directory
  * filenames and directories are properly uniquified
  * root directory
  * non-root directory
  * directory with denied write permission
* File extension
  * all valid file extension
  * invalid file extension - empty, non-empty
  * first layer - display dialog (interactive run mode)
  * subsequent layers - use last values (except file formats not supporting non-interactive run mode)
* Overwrite mode (non-interactive run mode only)
  * settings use the last overwrite mode
  * default mode - rename new files

Setting persistence
* no setting source
* persistent source only
* session-persistent source only
* both setting sources

Built-in operations
* procedures
* constraints
  * Only visible layers - visible layers with invisible parents must also be ignored

Custom operations
* add
* edit
  * adjust argument values
  * edit name
  * Reset
  * Cancel
* remove

Tagged layers in built-in operations

Preview
* layer names
  * layers are organized in folder structure, names are properly uniquified
  * "Include..." constraints
  * tags
    * assign tag to layer
    * add tag
    * remove tag
  * selected and not selected layers for the "Only layers selected in preview" constraint
* image
  * properly scaled image and procedures applied on the image
    * e.g. paintbrush coordinates must be made relative to the previewed image
  * dragging panes properly scales/downsizes image without artifacts


Unicode support
---------------

Review conformance to Unicode practices defined in the coding conventions.

Test:
* exporting more than once in one GIMP session (to test unicode strings in the GIMP shelf)
* overwrite dialog - all choices
* save settings with unicode strings
