Batcher is an upcoming [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) plug-in for exporting layers as separate images and editing layers.

Requires [GIMP 2.99.16](https://www.gimp.org/downloads/devel/) (a development version as a precursor to GIMP 3.0). Earlier or later GIMP versions will **not** work.

This is a work-in-progress plug-in that is currently not usable.


## Features

* Export in any file format provided by GIMP and third-party plug-ins
* Batch edit layers
* Customize processing with procedures and constraints
