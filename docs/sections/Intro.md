Batcher is an image automation plug-in for [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/). With Batcher, you can convert image files, export layers as images or batch-edit layers.

**Batcher requires [GIMP 3.0.0-RC2](https://www.gimp.org/downloads/devel/) or later.**


## What can Batcher do?

* Export images to any file format provided by GIMP and third-party plug-ins
* Apply arbitrary procedures during batch processing (rename, scale, insert background, filters, ...)
* Apply constraints to restrict the images/layers to process (only images matching a filename suffix, only visible layers, ...)
