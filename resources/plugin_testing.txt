================================================================================

Export Layers
---------------------

* interactive
   - load settings from GIMP shelf and config file
   - save settings to GIMP shelf after export
      - even if the export is cancelled or stopped prematurely
   - users chooses to save settings to config file (Save Settings)
   - Reset Settings
* non-interactive
   - don't load settings
   - save settings to GIMP shelf after export
* run-with-last-vals
   - load settings from GIMP shelf and config file
   - save settings to GIMP shelf after export

image = gimp.image_list()[0]
pdb.plug_in_export_layers(image, 'jpg', "D:\\testgimp\\test_export_layers", False, False, False, False, 0, 0, 0, 0, False, False, True, False, run_mode=RUN_WITH_LAST_VALS)
pdb.plug_in_export_layers_to(image)


Export Layers To
---------------------

* interactive
   - load settings from GIMP shelf and config file
   - first run
      - display Export Layers dialog
   - subsequent runs
      - display Export Layers To dialog
* non-interactive
   - same as run-with-last-vals
* run-with-last-vals
   - load settings from GIMP shelf and config file
   - save settings to GIMP shelf after export

Settings
---------------------

* Output directory
   - root directory
   - non-root directory
   - directory with denied write permission

* File format
   - all valid file formats
   - invalid file format - empty, non-empty
   - first layer - display dialog in interactive
   - subsequent layers - use last values (with a few exceptions, where dialog must always be displayed)

* Layer groups as directories
   - filenames and directories must be properly uniquified
* Merge layer groups
* Create empty subdirectories

* Ignore invisible
   - visible layers with invisible parents must also be ignored

* Autocrop
* Use image size instead of layer size
* square_bracketed_mode - Treat as background layers - Crop to layer
   - test these three settings with the PNG format since it supports the alpha channel, in which you can clearly see the differences in each setting combination
   - multiple background layers, in the same and in different places in the layer tree
   - layer group in [square brackets] - if Merge layer groups is enabled, it should also be treated as a background layer

* Overwrite mode (non-interactive run mode only)
   - make sure it uses the last overwrite mode
   - by default - rename_new

* file_ext_mode - No special handling - Always strip
* file_ext_mode - No special handling - Strip identical
* file_ext_mode - No special handling - Never strip
* file_ext_mode - Export only layers matching file format
   - invalid file format - empty, non-empty
* file_ext_mode - Use as file formats
   - no or invalid file extension in layers -> file format must be used
   - invalid file format - empty, non-empty

* square_bracketed_mode - Treat as normal layers
* square_bracketed_mode - Ignore
* square_bracketed_mode - Ignore other layers
   - Create directories for empty layer groups

* ignore layer modes

Unicode support
---------------------

Use unicode characters in:
* layers and layer groups
   * name the layers such that uniquification is performed
   * add invalid special characters to them (that get removed)
* input string parameters to PDB functions
   - use the non-interactive run mode
* GTK elements
   * text entry
   * directory chooser
   * combo boxes, labels, buttons, checkboxes, tooltips
      - temporarily modify settings in `settings_plugin`

Also test:
* exporting more than once in one GIMP session (to test unicode strings in the GIMP shelf)
* overwrite dialog - all choices
* Save Settings with unicode strings


Platforms
---------------------

* Windows
   - test everything
* Ubuntu
   - test all GUI dialogs - Export Layers, Export Layers To, overwrite dialog, exception dialog, warning dialog, info dialog
   - test Unicode stuff
   - test a few arbitrarily chosen settings
