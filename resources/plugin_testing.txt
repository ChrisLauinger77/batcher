Testing criteria
----------------

Platforms
* Windows
* Ubuntu

Plugins
* Export Layers
* Export Layers To

Run modes
* interactive
* non-interactive
* run-with-last-vals

All file formats
* first layer - display dialog in interactive
* subsequent layers - use last values (with a few exceptions, where dialog must always be displayed)

Settings
* not all combinations, only those settings that relate to each other

Setting persistence
* no setting source
* persistent source only
* session-persistent source only
* both setting sources

Layer names and filenames
* valid and invalid characters in filenames and directory names
* Unicode characters

Image types
* RGB
* RGBA
* grayscale
* indexed

Unicode support


Export Layers
-------------

Interactive
* load settings from GIMP shelf and config file
* save settings to GIMP shelf after export
* save settings to GIMP shelf if the export is cancelled or stopped prematurely
* users chooses to save settings to config file (Save Settings)
* Reset Settings

Non-interactive
* don't load settings
* save settings to GIMP shelf after export

image = gimp.image_list()[0]
pdb.plug_in_export_layers(image, 'jpg', r"D:\testgimp\test_export_layers", False, False, False, False, 0, 0, 0, False, False, True, False, 0, run_mode=RUN_NONINTERACTIVE)

Run-with-last-vals
* load settings from GIMP shelf and config file
* save settings to GIMP shelf after export

image = gimp.image_list()[0]
pdb.plug_in_export_layers(image, 'jpg', r"D:\testgimp\test_export_layers", False, False, False, False, 0, 0, 0, False, False, True, False, 0, run_mode=RUN_WITH_LAST_VALS)

pdb.plug_in_export_layers_to(image)


Export Layers To
----------------

Interactive
* load settings from GIMP shelf and config file
* first run
  * display Export Layers dialog
* subsequent runs
  * display Export Layers To dialog

Non-interactive
* same as Run-with-last-vals

Run-with-last-vals
* load settings from GIMP shelf and config file
* save settings to GIMP shelf after export


Settings
--------

Output directory
* root directory
* non-root directory
* directory with denied write permission

File format
* all valid file formats
* invalid file format - empty, non-empty
* first layer - display dialog in interactive
* subsequent layers - use last values (with a few exceptions, where dialog must always be displayed)

Layer groups as folders
* filenames and directories must be properly uniquified

Merge layer groups

Create folders for empty layer groups

Ignore invisible
* visible layers with invisible parents must also be ignored

Autocrop

Use image size

Layer names in [square brackets] - Treat as background layers - Crop to layer
* test these three settings with the PNG format since it supports the alpha channel, in which you can clearly see the differences in each setting combination
* multiple background layers, in the same and in different places in the layer tree
* layer group in [square brackets] - if Merge layer groups is enabled, it should also be treated as a background layer

Overwrite mode (non-interactive run mode only)
* make sure it uses the last overwrite mode
* by default - rename_new

File extensions in layer names
* No special handling - Always strip
* No special handling - Strip identical
* No special handling - Never strip
* Export only layers matching file format
  * invalid file format - empty, non-empty
* Use as file formats
  * no or invalid file extension in layers -> file format must be used
  * invalid file format - empty, non-empty

Layer names in [square brackets]
* square_bracketed_mode - Treat as normal layers
* square_bracketed_mode - Ignore
* square_bracketed_mode - Ignore other layers
* square_bracketed_mode - Ignore other layers + Create folders for empty layer groups

Ignore layer modes


Unicode support
---------------

Use unicode characters in:
* layers and layer groups
   * name the layers such that uniquification is performed
   * add invalid special characters to them (that get removed)
* input string parameters to PDB functions
   - use the non-interactive run mode
* GTK elements
   * text entry
   * folder chooser
   * combo boxes, labels, buttons, checkboxes, tooltips
      * temporarily modify settings in `settings_plugin`

Also test:
* exporting more than once in one GIMP session (to test unicode strings in the GIMP shelf)
* overwrite dialog - all choices
* Save Settings with unicode strings


Platforms
---------

Windows
* test everything

Ubuntu
* test all GUI dialogs - Export Layers, Export Layers To, overwrite dialog, exception dialog, warning dialog, info dialog
* test Unicode stuff
* test a few arbitrarily chosen settings
