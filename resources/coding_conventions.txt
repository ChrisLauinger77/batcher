Coding conventions
==================

This document describes coding conventions not entirely obvious from the code itself.


Glossary
--------

element = module, class, function, variable


Quotes in and around Strings
----------------------------

* double quotes:
  * everywhere except cases where single quotes are used
* single quotes:
  * element names in non-user messages (to be consistent with e.g. Python exception messages)
  * any string containing double quotes (to avoid inserting backslashes)
* backquotes:
  * element names in comments


Mixins
------

* mixins can access and modify only those attributes defined in it
* no other classes should directly modify attributes defined in mixins


Imports
-------

* use explicit relative imports
  * for library modules, this avoids dependency on the application using the library
* import whole modules, do not import individual classes, functions or variables
