## Upcoming

Redesigned user interface:
* Replaced the folder chooser widget with a folder chooser button.
* Procedures and constraints are now aligned vertically.
* Procedures and constraints can now be edited directly in the main dialog rather than a separate dialog. Action settings can be expanded or collapsed by pressing the button with the edit icon.
* Adjusted layout accordingly given the changes above (dialog dimensions, positions of separators, spacing/margins/border width).

Bug fixes:
* Fixed crash for procedures containing GIMP resources (brushes, palettes, gradients, patterns) as settings.
