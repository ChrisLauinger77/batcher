Batcher is a [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) plug-in for batch-exporting layers as separate images and batch-editing layers.

**Batcher currently requires [GIMP 2.99.18](https://www.gimp.org/downloads/devel/) (a development version as a precursor to GIMP 3.0). Earlier or later GIMP versions will _not_ work.**


## What can Batcher do?

* Export layers in any file format provided by GIMP and third-party plug-ins
* Batch edit layers with any GIMP procedure or plug-in
* Limit export/editing to layers matching constraints
