# [![](docs/images/logo.svg)](https://kamilburda.github.io/batcher/) Batcher

Batcher is an image automation plug-in for [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/). With Batcher, you can mass-convert image files, export layers or edit layers.

**Batcher requires [GIMP 3.0.0-RC2](https://www.gimp.org/downloads/devel/) or later.**


## What can Batcher do?

* Export images to any file format provided by GIMP and third-party plug-ins
* Apply arbitrary procedures (scale, insert background, layer effects, ...) during batch processing
* Apply constraints to restrict the images/layers to process (only images matching a suffix, only visible layers, ...)
